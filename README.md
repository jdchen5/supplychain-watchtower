# Supplychain Watchtower

**Supplychain Watchtower** is the engine behind the **Cybersecurity Neighborhood Watch**, a community-driven initiative by [Ortelius](https://github.com/ortelius) designed to protect the open-source ecosystem. Just like a neighborhood watch keeps an eye out for unusual activity, this initiative monitors software projects to spot vulnerabilities, outdated packages, and risky dependencies before they become a problem.

- 🏘️ **Community-First**: Developers share signals and insights, helping everyone stay safer.  
- 👀 **Continuous Monitoring**: Tracks new software releases and CVEs in real time, enabling proactive responses.  
- 🚨 **Early Warning System**: Automated alerts act as “eyes on the street” for the software supply chain.  
- 🤝 **Collective Security**: The more projects participate, the stronger and more resilient the ecosystem becomes.

Supplychain Watchtower runs as a **GitHub Actions–driven automation service**, continuously watching upstream releases, updating the Ortelius database, and triggering CI/CD pipelines. It uses **AI Model Context Protocol (AI MCP) agents** to automatically create pull requests with updated dependency files in forked repositories—keeping the software supply chain secure, up-to-date, and transparent for everyone.

In short, **Supplychain Watchtower automates the heavy lifting of software supply chain security**, continuously scanning for changes, maintaining accurate dependency data, and enabling AI-driven remediation pipelines.
